# eventigrate
Sample program developped as exercise for Eventigrate

ARCHITECTURE:
- The program is written in python
- The database used is a local sqlite3 database
- The output is stored in a csv file

REMARK: This program is developped with the idea in mind that a free subscription on fixer.io only allows for 1000 api calls 
per month. The program is developped to send as little get requests as possible, at a cost of more memory usage.
